	This image is available on DockerHub. To download it run:

	$ docker pull openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
	```

	To build a MongoDB image from scratch run:

	```
	$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mongodb.git
	$ cd mongodb
	$ make build VERSION=2.4
	```

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed
on all provided versions of MongoDB.**
